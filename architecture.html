                    CountingCurls will utilize a layered architecture for its web-based application. 
                    There will be five layers: Web Browser, Authentication and User Interface Management, Application Services, 
                    Basic Services, and Databases. Every layer contains a few components that each complete their own task and 
                    do not overlap. The components are grouped by their similar functionality, making layers logically coherent. <br>

                <div class="body" id="notes2body">
                <p>
                    CountingCurls will use a service-oriented distribution architecture. Since the services are stateless components, 
                    they can be replicated and migrated from one computer to another â€“ making the application easier to scale as demand 
                    hopefully increases. A service-oriented distribution architecture will also work well with the cloud database we plan to 
                    run CountingCurls on. All of these features combined will make it easier for new functionalities to be added in the future. <br>

                    <h3>Database</h3> CountingCurls will be handling simple amounts of data, but the information needs to be consistent and accurate; 
                    therefore, we will be using a relational database to store data, which will support ACID transactions to guarantee our data 
                    remains reliable. 
                    <h3>Platform</h3> Initially, CountingCurls will be deployed on a web-based platform. This will allow us to control the version of 
                    CountingCurls that users are running. Users will have immediate access to the most up-to-date security and additional features 
                    without having to update a mobile app. 
                    <h3>Server</h3> CountingCurls will utilize Google Cloud as its server. Using a cloud server will allow CountingCurls to scale as it grows 
                    and Google provides more discounts than its competitors, which is critical for a new software with limited funds. 
                    <h3>Open Source</h3> CountingCurls will take advantage of open-source software, such as MySQL as its relational database management system, 
                    and Hanko as a user authentication service. Reusing these software systems instead of writing our own will allow us to reduce
                    development costs and the time it takes to get CountingCurls on the market. Also, utilizing Hanko, which authenticates users with 
                    passcodes instead of passwords, will keep our data secure without burdening our users with extreme security hoops to jump through 
                    to use our software. 
                    <h3>Development Tools</h3>CountingCurls will be written using Java on the backend and Javascript and Angular for the frontend.

                    CountingCurls UI will be coded in HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML will set the frame of the site with Javascript being utilized to dynamically
                    add input methods the users can use to input data such as the weight they are lifting, how many sets they are doing along with the repititions 
                    they do for each set. CSS will be used to format the look of the site with a consistent theme throughtout.
