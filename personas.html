                <h2>Persona 1: Jill</h2>
                <p>
                    Jill is a 51-year-old woman who lives in Missouri. She has a husband who is a factory worker and two college-aged children. 
                    Jill attended community college for a year before she became pregnant. She stayed home to watch the kids and never returned to college. 
                    She works as a receptionist for a law office where she answers the phone, uses a scheduling system to set up appointments, 
                    and uses a payment system to take payments. Outside of these tasks, Jill has pretty limited experience with technology. 
                    Her children often help her with tasks involving a computer or apps on her phone. <br><br>  

                    Recently, Jill went for an annual checkup and received some less-than-desirable lab results. Following her doctor’s recommendations, 
                    Jill made getting healthy her New Year’s resolution. Before having kids, she used to exercise at home along with workout tapes. 
                    She has never been to a gym before and she has never developed her own fitness routine. She feels overwhelmed and wants to find an app 
                    that will help her in her fitness journey.

            <h2>Persona 2: Chris</h2>
            <p>
                Chris, age 25, is a college student who has returned to school to pursue a degree in an accelerated computer science program. 
                He lives with his parents in Seattle, WA and he is an only child. He graduated from the University of Washington with a bachelor’s degree 
                in Biology and works as a research assistant at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Chris is a fitness hobbyist and exercises for his health 
                and well-being. He barely has time as he works full-time and attends evening classes for his computer science program. Despite his hectic schedule, 
                Chris goes to the gym every day to exercise for at least an hour. <br><br>

                Chris is well versed in fitness trackers and has used a few fitness apps in the past. The ones he used did not align with his needs and 
                because of the cost associated with the apps, he now has a notebook to write all his exercises. He does not	enjoy carrying a notebook around 
                the gym and acknowledges that there is a need to have an app he can use that can ease and enhance his exercise workout routines that is free of cost.

            <h2>Persona 3: Matt</h2>
            <p>
                Matt, age 29, is an RN at the local hospital in Michigan. He works on the progressive care unit taking care of a wide variety of patients. 
                He is planning on making the move to travel nursing so he can visit other places while having a steady job. He recently just got engaged to his partner 
                and they are both planning on doing travel nursing together. They do not have any kids yet, but plan on it later when they eventually settle down in a spot 
                they want to call home. <br><br>

                Matt is extremely into fitness and weightlifting. When he’s not working, you can find him in the gym exercising for hours on end. He has an in-depth knowledge 
                of exercises and workout regiments, but is always on the lookout for more things he can do. He is pretty good with technology, having to use a wide variety 
                of tech at his job. He is worried though that when he starts traveling, it might be harder to consistently find a gym company that he likes to lift at, 
                as the equipment can vary drastically from one another. He usually keeps a mental note about his progress and what he does in the gym, but is also 
                concerned that when he starts moving to different places, it will be harder to do without a consistent place to go. He is looking for an app to help 
                record his numbers so that even when his travels get hectic, he has a place to check his progress that he is familiar with.
