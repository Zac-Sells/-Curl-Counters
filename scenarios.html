                <h2>Chris is up for a challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Chris has been asked by his close co-worker to participate in Fred Hutch Obliteride annual bike ride charity marathon. 
                    The Fred Hutch Obliteride annual marathon is a united global community that aims to take action in the fight of cancer by 
                    raising funds and awareness for lifesaving research. For participants, it is also a healthy yearly habit as they start to 
                    prepare for the event several months in advance by exercise and staying fit. In the previous year, the event raised $4.8 million
                    for Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. For Chris, he believes in his work's mission to fight cancer and decided to commit and prepare 
                    for the event ahead of time. He wants to start exercising and improve his fitness goals by doing a lot of cardio exercise before 
                    taking his bike out.<br>  

                    <br>Chrisâ€™s plan is to start with stretches, do cardio, and be on the treadmill for minutes to boost his fitness and heartbeat. 
                    Chris usually carries a notebook and writes down all his workout routines, but he sees there is need for an app that can ease
                    that he can track his workout routine. He wants an app to write down his plans before he goes to the gym, and he checks them one 
                    by one as he does his workouts. He also wants an app that stores all his workout routines so that he can look at his progress. <br>

                <h2>Matt is Moving</h2>

                <p>
                   Matts contract is almost up with the hospital he has been assigned to for the last three months. He just
                   accepted another contract in the same state of Colorado just in another city. He and his partner are
                   planning to move there soon after their contract has officially expired. The gym he has been going to the 
                   past few months doesn't have a location near the area so he is looking for a new one.<br>

                   <br>He checks online to see what gyms are in the area but they do not give a very good description of them.
                   He works night shift as well so its hard for him to find time to call when they are open. He checks the
                   Counting Curls app and searches gyms in the area he is moving to. He selects on some gyms he sees and 
                   reads the review left by other users.<br>

                   <br>He prefers gyms that cater more to the serious lifters so he looks at the tags left by other users such as
                   "Weightlifter Friendly" and "Powerlifting Friendly". These are good signs that the gym will offer
                   appropriate equipment for his needs while also highlighting some important information about the gym
                   culture. In the review, he is able to see feedback from other users about the pricing and their 
                   experiences at the gym which gives him a good idea of which gyms he wants to visit when he finally
                   moves.<br>
