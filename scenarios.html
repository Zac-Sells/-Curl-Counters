                <h2>Jill's Yoga Journey</h2>
                <div class="body" id="notes1body">
                <p>
                        Jill uses Counting Curls to research different types of exercises, and where to do them. Through the app,
                        she finds a gym near her home that offers group classes and she is particularly interested in yoga. She 
                        begins to take yoga classes at the gym three days a week, but feels like she is getting tired very quickly
                        and doesn't see much progress. Jill needs a way to track her yoga sessions so she can see that she is
                        improving and stay motivated. She is a visual person and would really like to see a graphic of all the yoga 
                        poses she has learned in such a short period of time. Jill finds that the community aspect of the yoga classes
                        is what she loves most about it. She would like to connect with her partners on Counting Curls for support
                        and to see how other people with her condition are doing.

                <h2>Jill's Evolution</h2>
                <div class="body" id="notes2body">
                <p>
                        Jill is looking for a new way to get out of the house and meet new people while also working on her health.
                        She looks at the local options in Counting Curls and sees a local walking group that meets twice a week in
                        the morning. The group is led by a certified personal trainer and focuses on strength training and 
                        cardiovascular health. Jill is excited by this opportunity and looks more into it. She decides to give it
                        a try and signs up for the group. At first, it is difficult for her to get up early and make it to the 
                        meetings. She really needs the encouragement of the other members to convince her to get out of bed. A 
                        "friend" feature of Counting Curls would allow the group members to make posts and send messages to each
                        other. A workout reminder feature on Counting Curls would also help nudge her to get going in the morning.<br>

                        <br>As she becomes more active, she notices changes in her energy levels and overall well-being. She starts
                        to feel more confident and motivated to push herself. Over time, Jill becomes a regular member of the group
                        and begins to set new fitness goals for herself. Jill is very motivated by to-do lists and the satisfaction
                        received when checking off items as complete. She would like to be able to select walking goals in the 
                        Counting Curls app and mark them off once she meets them. Jill inspires her husband and children to join 
                        along side her in her healthy habits. Since participating in the walking group, Jill has improved her physical
                        health along with her social and mental well being. She feels more connected to her community and family which
                        has given her a renewed sense of purpose.

                <p>
                     With winter coming up, Jill is interested in finding a new exercise to start doing. She doesn't want to walk 
                     outside in the cold and she finds walking on a treadmill boring. She enjoys her yoga classes, but she is looking 
                     to incorporate more cardio into her workout routine. Jill opens up Counting Curls and researches different cardio
                     techniques where she sees information about swimming. This seems like a perfect fit for her! Her local gym has an 
                     indoor pool, so the weather won't be a concern, and swimming is a low-impact sport that will be easy on her joints.
                     She starts out by just doing a few laps, but after a couple weeks, she decides she would like a more formal routine.
                     She's not sure where to start so she looks at the suggested swimming plans for beginners available on 
                     Counting Curls. Once that regimen becomes easy for her, Jill moves on to an intermediate training plan she found on
                     on the app. She would like to be able to see what other swimmers in the area are doing and compare her statistics to theirs.
                     She wishes users could enter their swimming times along with distance in the Counting Curls app and it would 
                     display it anonymously for other users to see. With the holidays coming up, Jill's schedule is becoming very busy.
                     She needs to schedule her workouts in advance so she doesn't double book herself or run out of time to swim.

                <p>
                     Chris has been working on his physical body appearance. Even though he has been working out, he realized he gained weight
                     and is far from where he wanted to be. He wants to change his diet and revise his workout routines as they haven’t been 
                     effective. His goal is to lose some weight and also build his body. He wants to put time into lifting weights and gain muscle.
                     He has been tracking his fitness workout routines with his notebook but wants to try using workout routine apps. He is 
                     interested in an app that he can use to build his workout routines and track his progress. He also wants an app that suggests
                     a healthy diet based on his health, fitness and goals. He previously used some other fitness apps, but he didn’t like them 
                     and wants to try using Counting Curls as it has the features he is looking for.

                <p>
                    Chris has been asked by his close co-worker to participate in Fred Hutch Obliteride annual bike ride charity marathon. 
                    The Fred Hutch Obliteride annual marathon is a united global community that aims to take action in the fight of cancer by 
                    raising funds and awareness for lifesaving research. For participants, it is also a healthy yearly habit as they start to 
                    prepare for the event several months in advance by exercise and staying fit. In the previous year, the event raised $4.8 million
                    for Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. For Chris, he believes in his work's mission to fight cancer and decided to commit and prepare 
                    for the event ahead of time. He wants to start exercising and improve his fitness goals by doing a lot of cardio exercise before 
                    taking his bike out.<br>  

                    <br>Chris’s plan is to start with stretches, and run on the treadmill for a few minutes to boost his fitness and cardiovascular health. 
                    Chris usually carries a notebook and writes down all his workout routines, but he sees there is need for an app that can easily
                    track his workout routines. He wants an app to write down his plans before he goes to the gym, and he checks them one 
                    by one as he does his workouts. He also wants an app that stores all his workout routines so that he can look at his progress as 
                    he continues to exercise. <br>

                <p>
                    Chris has seen a lot of improvements in his workout routines. He is gaining the fitness level he wanted and has gained a 
                    bulk of muscle. He is eating a healthy diet and tracks all his calorie intake and calories burned. His health also 
                    improved, as he previously used to feel exhausted and felt discouraged to do anything. He is now very active and is motivated to
                    go beyond in everything he is doing. He is also managing his mental health as he found a long-term solution to his lasting 
                    stress. All his success is due to Counting Curls. He inputs all his workout routines, tracks his progress and gets visual
                    representation in graphs. He is also enjoying the healthy diet based on his health status as it changes on his goals. He would 
                    like to add his family to Counting Curls and is interested in a feature that allows him to share his progress with his family.

                <p>
                    Matts contract is almost up with the hospital he has been assigned to for the last three months. He just
                   accepted another contract in the same state of Colorado, just in another city. He and his partner are
                   planning to move there soon after their contract has officially expired. The gym he has been going to the 
                   past few months doesn't have a location near the area so he is looking for a new one.<br>

                   <br>He checks online to see what gyms are in the area, but they do not give a very good description of them.
                   He works night shift as well, so it's hard for him to find time to call when they are open. He opens the
                   Counting Curls app and wishes he could search gyms in the area he is moving to and see what other users were 
                   doing at those gyms to get an idea of what's avaliable.<br>

                   <br>He prefers gyms that cater more to the serious lifters, so if there were tags left by other users such as
                   "Weightlifter Friendly" and "Powerlifter Friendly", these would be good signs that the gym will offer
                   appropriate equipment for his needs while also highlighting some important information about the gym
                   culture. The reviews could also offer feedback about the gym as a whole, referencing pricing and hidden fees 
                   that he may not be aware of. This would help him narrow down his search so he can spend less time visiting
                   gyms that would not be a good fit.<br>

                <h2>Winter Bulk</h2>
                <div class="body" id="notes8body">
                <p>
                    Matt has been enjoying his new contract in Colorado. He has even found a gym that he likes to regularly workout
                    at. It's officialy winter time so the snow has begun to fall all around him. He thinks this is the perfect time
                    to try and eat more calories to increase his muscle gain. He wants to bulk up so he can start his cut during
                    the spring.<br>

                    <br>He uses Counting Curls to track his workouts which gives him stats on what he is lifting and also how many 
                    calories he is burning. He needs though to start tracking how many calories he eats a day and compare it to how
                    much he is burning. He sees other apps that will track what he eats but wishes he wouldn't have to do all the 
                    math himself comparing the calories he burns versus what he intakes. He wishes the Counting Curls app would allow
                    him to enter his caloric intake for the day so he can see his net gains or losses, allowing him to easily navigate
                    his bulk or cut.

                <p>
                    Matt has been making a lot of friends in his new contract in Colorado. He has regular people he hangs out with,
                    both at work and at the gym. He likes to talk to his friends in the gym about their workout regimens and what 
                    their lifting numbers currently are. It's hard for him though, as his schedule is hectic with working night
                    shift; he sometimes has to go to the gym at odd hours when no one is there. He wishes there was a way he could
                    share his progress and results and view theirs without having to see them every day.<br>
                    
                    <br> He feels with the Counting Curls app, it would be beneficial to allow other users to view his workout
                    tracking results and vice versa. It could be as simple as a setting that you enter a username and then they can
                    see and comment on what you're inputting for your results. He believes this would also help motivate him to keep 
                    up the hard work as others would be able to see if he wasn't following up with his training.
