                <h2>Matt is Moving</h2>

                <p>
                   Matts contract is almost up with the hospital he has been assigned to for the last three months. He just
                   accepted another contract in the same state of Colorado just in another city. He and his partner are
                   planning to move there soon after their contract has officially expired. The gym he has been going to the 
                   past few months doesn't have a location near the area so he is looking for a new one.<br>

                   <br>He checks online to see what gyms are in the area but they do not give a very good description of them.
                   He works night shift as well so its hard for him to find time to call when they are open. He checks the
                   Counting Curls app and searches gyms in the area he is moving to. He selects on some gyms he sees and 
                   reads the review left by other users.<br>

                   <br>He prefers gyms that cater more to the serious lifters so he looks at the tags left by other users such as
                   "Weightlifter Friendly" and "Powerlifting Friendly". These are good signs that the gym will offer
                   appropriate equipment for his needs while also highlighting some important information about the gym
                   culture. In the review, he is able to see feedback from other users about the pricing and their 
                   experiences at the gym which gives him a good idea of which gyms he wants to visit when he finally
                   moves.<br>
