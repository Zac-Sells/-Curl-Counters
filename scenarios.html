                <h2>Chris is up for a challenge</h2>
                <div class="body" id="notes5body">
                <p>
                    Chris has been asked by his close co-worker to participate in Fred Hutch Obliteride annual bike ride charity marathon. 
                    The Fred Hutch Obliteride annual marathon is a united global community that aims to take action in the fight of cancer by 
                    raising funds and awareness for lifesaving research. For participants, it is also a healthy yearly habit as they start to 
                    prepare for the event several months in advance by exercise and staying fit. In the previous year, the event raised $4.8 million
                    for Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. For Chris, he believes in his work's mission to fight cancer and decided to commit and prepare 
                    for the event ahead of time. He wants to start exercising and improve his fitness goals by doing a lot of cardio exercise before 
                    taking his bike out.<br>  

                    <br>Chrisâ€™s plan is to start with stretches, do cardio, and be on the treadmill for minutes to boost his fitness and heartbeat. 
                    Chris usually carries a notebook and writes down all his workout routines, but he sees there is need for an app that can ease
                    that he can track his workout routine. He wants an app to write down his plans before he goes to the gym, and he checks them one 
                    by one as he does his workouts. He also wants an app that stores all his workout routines so that he can look at his progress. <br>

                <h2>Matt is Moving</h2>

                <p>
                    Matts contract is almost up with the hospital he has been assigned to for the last three months. He just
                   accepted another contract in the same state of Colorado just in another city. He and his partner are
                   planning to move there soon after their contract has officially expired. The gym he has been going to the 
                   past few months doesn't have a location near the area so he is looking for a new one.<br>

                   <br>He checks online to see what gyms are in the area but they do not give a very good description of them.
                   He works night shift as well so it's hard for him to find time to call when they are open. He opens the
                   Counting Curls app and wishes he could search gyms in the area he is moving to and see what other users were 
                   doing at those gyms to get an idea of what's avaliable.<br>

                   <br>He prefers gyms that cater more to the serious lifters so if there were tags left by other users such as
                   "Weightlifter Friendly" and "Powerlifter Friendly", these would be good signs that the gym will offer
                   appropriate equipment for his needs while also highlighting some important information about the gym
                   culture. The reviews could also offer feedback about the gym as a whole referencing pricing and hidden fees 
                   that he may not be aware about. This would help him narrow down his search so he can spend less time visiting
                   gyms that would not be a good fit.<br>

                <h2>Winter Bulk</h2>
                <div class="body" id="notes8body">
                <p>
                    Matt has been enjoying his new contract in Colorado. He has even found a gym that he likes to regularly workout
                    at. It's officialy winter time so the snow has begun to fall all around him. He thinks this is the perfect time
                    to try and eat more calories to increase his muscle gain. He wants to bulk up so he can start his cut during
                    the spring.<br>

                    <br>He uses Counting Curls to track his workouts which gives him stats on what he is lifting and also how many 
                    calories he is burning. He needs though to start tracking how many calories he eats a day and compare it to how
                    much he is burning. He sees other apps that will track what he eats but wishes he wouldn't have to do all the 
                    math himself comparing the calories he burns verses what he intakes. He wishes the Counting Curl app would allow
                    him to enter his caloric intake for the day so he can see his net gains or loses allowing him to easily navigate
                    his bulk or cut.

                <h2>Friends Who Lift Together...</h2>
                <div class="body" id="notes9body">
                <p>
                    Matt has been making a lot of friends in his new contract in Colorado. He has regular people he hangs out with
                    both at work and at the gym. He likes to talk to his friends in the gym about their workout regiments and what 
                    their lifting numbers currently are. It's hard for him though as his schedule is hectic with working night
                    shift, he sometimes has to go to the gym at odd hours when no one is there. He wishes there was a way he could
                    share his progress and results and view thiers without having to see them every day.<br>
                    
                    <br> He feels with the Counting Curls app, it would be beneficial to allow other users to view his workout
                    tracking results and vice versa. It could be as simple as a setting that you enter a username and then they can
                    see and comment on what you're inputting for your results. He believes this would also help motivate him to keep 
                    up the hard work as others would be able to see if he wasn't following up with his training.
