                <p>
                    The app will need to handle many users and gyms, which may require significant resources and infrastructure. <br>

                    <br>The app will need access to information about gyms, such as location, amenities, and user reviews. This data
                     may be challenging to acquire, particularly if gyms do not have a solid online presence.

                    Based on Jill and Matt’s scenarios, constant use of GPS can drain the battery of the user's device; the feature should 
                    be designed to minimize the impact on battery life.

                    Users may have concerns about sharing personal information about their mental health with the app, 
                    and the development team will need to consider these concerns when designing the feature.

                    Based on Jill and Matt’s scenarios, the feature will need to be designed to encourage users to engage
                     with it and continue using it over time.
