                    Brennan is an avid gym goer who says he exercises at least seven days a week and competes in CrossFit competitions. 
                    He currently is a member at two gyms, but says he is always on the lookout for a new place to work out. 
                    Brennans favorite forms of exercise consist of weightlifting, biking, running, and CrossFit classes. 
                    Brennan has used several fitness apps in the past but has always reverted to keeping track of his workout routines and progress on a spreadsheet. 
                    Brennan met the idea of CountingCurls with loads of excitement; He was particularly excited about features such as the graphical aspect of CountingCurls 
                    along with the idea of being able to review and recommend gyms and trainers. 
                    The most important feature to Brennan was a smart workout log that could recognize particular exercises and workout routines to minimize the time tracking information 
                    and maximize time in the gym. Brennan suggested the idea of including a social feed feature to the app where users could post and share their workouts and progress with friends. 
                    Brennan did not voice any concerns surrounding CountingCurls.

                    Taylor is an occasional gym goer who spends most of her time either lifting weights and walking on either the stair climber or treadmill. 
                    She attends the gym three to four days a week and is currently a member at a large chain gym. Taylor was enthusiastic about the idea of CountingCurls. 
                    She has never used an app to keep track of her fitness records or progress but jumped at the idea of using CountingCurls. 
                    The main features that piqued her interest were the nutrition and supplement recommendation. 
                    Taylor proposed the idea of integrating the app with existing smart watches and fitness bands. 
                    She thinks a good idea would be to include a feature where users can view transmitted information regarding their workouts such as calories burned and heart rate.

                    Austin has never worked out at a traditional weightlifting gym before but is open to giving it a shot to improve his overall wellness. He currently is not a member of any sort of gym, 
                    but he does run outdoors every now and then. Due to the fact he has never been a gym goer, he has never had the need to use a fitness tracking app. 
                    He thought the overall idea of CountingCurls seemed interesting and would be willing to use it if he decided to join a gym. He appreciated the feature that includes instructions for 
                    different exercises, workout routines, and muscle group information. Although he currently has no need for the product, he offered a few recommendations. 
                    Being someone who has never had a gym membership he appreciated the review and recommended feature as well. 
                    Austin suggested a feature that would remind users to go to the gym based on a time cycle setup by the user. 
                    His only concern was that there are many fitness apps on the market, and as someone who is new to the fitness world, how would he know to choose CountingCurls over a competitor?
